**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 24th April 2025
**Owner:** Chirag Singhal
**Status:** final
**Prepared for:** AI Code Assistant

---

**1. Introduction & Overview**

*   **1.1. Purpose:** This document outlines the requirements for "QR Code Scanner Pro," a mobile application for iOS and Android built using React Native (Expo). Its primary function is to provide users with a fast, reliable, and user-friendly way to scan QR codes and interact with the encoded data. This PRD serves as a blueprint for development, specifically intended for use by an AI code assistant.
*   **1.2. Problem Statement:** Users need a dedicated, efficient, and feature-rich application to scan various types of QR codes encountered in daily life (URLs, contact info, Wi-Fi credentials, text, etc.) and take appropriate actions based on the content, potentially managing a history of their scans. While built-in camera apps offer basic scanning, a dedicated app can provide enhanced features, better data handling, history management, and a focused user experience.
*   **1.3. Vision / High-Level Solution:** To create a best-in-class, production-ready QR code scanning application using modern React Native tools and practices. The app will offer seamless scanning, intelligent data parsing, actionable options, user authentication for potential future cloud features (like sync), and a persistent scan history, all wrapped in a clean and performant user interface.

**2. Goals & Objectives**

*   **2.1. Business Goals:**
    *   Deliver a fully functional, high-quality QR scanning utility app.
    *   Establish a foundation for potential future feature expansion (e.g., code generation, advanced history management).
*   **2.2. Product Goals:**
    *   Provide fast and accurate QR code scanning.
    *   Automatically detect and parse common QR code data types.
    *   Offer contextually relevant actions for scanned data.
    *   Allow users to view and manage their scan history.
    *   Ensure a smooth, intuitive, and visually appealing user experience on both iOS and Android.
    *   Implement user authentication using Clerk for potential future features and basic user management.
*   **2.3. Success Metrics (KPIs):**
    *   Scan Success Rate (>98%).
    *   Average time from app open to successful scan (< 3 seconds).
    *   User retention rate (Monthly Active Users).
    *   Crash-free sessions rate (>99.5%).
    *   Positive App Store ratings (Target > 4.5 stars).

**3. Scope**

*   **3.1. In Scope:**
    *   Development of a React Native (Expo) application using TypeScript.
    *   Real-time camera preview for scanning.
    *   QR code detection and decoding using `react-native-vision-camera`.
    *   Parsing of common data types: URL, Text, vCard/MeCard (Contact), Wi-Fi Credentials, SMS, Email, Geo-location.
    *   Displaying scanned data clearly to the user.
    *   Providing context-aware actions (e.g., "Open URL", "Add Contact", "Connect to Wi-Fi", "Copy Text").
    *   Persistent local storage of scan history (timestamp, data type, preview/content) using `react-native-mmkv`.
    *   User authentication (Sign Up, Sign In, Sign Out) using `Clerk`. (Note: Initially, login might gate access to history or future sync features, TBD based on final flow).
    *   Basic settings screen (e.g., toggle sound/vibration on scan).
    *   Clean, intuitive UI styled with `NativeWind`.
    *   Basic animations/transitions using `react-native-reanimated` for a smoother feel.
    *   Implementation within the specified `frontend/` folder structure.
    *   Comprehensive error handling and reporting using `Sentry` / `Bugsnag`.
    *   Unit and integration testing using `React Native Testing Library`.
    *   End-to-end UI testing using `Maestro`.
    *   Use of `Expo Router` for navigation.
    *   Use of `Expo Image` for any image display needs (e.g., icons).
    *   Potential use of `Zego` for context menus (e.g., on history items).
    *   Use of `react-native-gesture-handler` (likely included with dependencies).
*   **3.2. Out of Scope:**
    *   Scanning of other barcode types (e.g., EAN, UPC, Code 128).
    *   Generating QR codes.
    *   Cloud synchronization of scan history (unless explicitly added later).
    *   Advanced history features (e.g., bulk actions, complex filtering/searching beyond simple text match, folders/tags).
    *   Backend API development beyond Clerk integration.
    *   In-app purchases or monetization features.
    *   Web or Desktop versions.

**4. User Personas & Scenarios**

*   **4.1. Primary Persona(s):**
    *   **Everyday User (Tech-Savvy):** Alex, 30. Uses smartphone apps daily. Encounters QR codes on posters, products, websites, and for Wi-Fi access. Wants a quick, reliable scanner that remembers past scans and makes it easy to act on the information. May appreciate features like history. Values privacy and a clean interface.
*   **4.2. Key User Scenarios / Use Cases:**
    *   **Scan & Go:** Alex opens the app, points it at a QR code on a poster, the app instantly recognizes it as a URL, displays it, and Alex taps "Open URL" to visit the website.
    *   **Add Contact:** Alex scans a QR code on a business card (vCard), the app recognizes the contact details, displays them, and Alex taps "Add Contact" to save it to their phone's address book.
    *   **Connect to Wi-Fi:** Alex scans a QR code provided by a cafe, the app recognizes the Wi-Fi network details (SSID, password, security type), and Alex taps "Connect to Wi-Fi" to join the network.
    *   **Recall Past Scan:** Alex remembers scanning a product QR code last week. They open the app, go to the History screen, scroll or search, find the relevant entry, and view the details or re-trigger the action.
    *   **Manage Account:** Alex signs up for an account using their Google profile via Clerk to potentially back up their history in the future (even if sync isn't in v1, auth is).

**5. User Stories**

*   **US1:** As a user, I want to open the app and immediately see a camera view ready to scan, so I can scan QR codes quickly.
*   **US2:** As a user, I want the app to automatically detect and decode QR codes presented to the camera, so I don't have to manually trigger the scan.
*   **US3:** As a user, I want the app to display the content of the scanned QR code clearly, so I know what information it contains.
*   **US4:** As a user, I want the app to identify the type of data in the QR code (URL, Contact, Wi-Fi, etc.) and offer relevant action buttons, so I can easily interact with the data.
*   **US5:** As a user, I want the app to save a history of my scanned codes locally, so I can refer back to them later.
*   **US6:** As a user, I want to be able to view my scan history in a list format, showing key details like date/time and content snippet.
*   **US7:** As a user, I want to be able to tap on a history item to view its full details and potentially re-trigger the associated action.
*   **US8:** As a user, I want to be able to copy the raw text content of any scanned QR code to my clipboard.
*   **US9:** As a user, I want to be able to sign up and log in using my email or social providers (via Clerk), so my identity is managed for potential future features.
*   **US10:** As a user, I want basic feedback (e.g., sound, vibration) upon a successful scan, configurable in settings.
*   **US11:** As a user, I want the app interface to be clean, responsive, and easy to navigate using standard mobile patterns (e.g., bottom tabs via Expo Router).

    *   **History Screen:** List view of past scans (icon/type, content preview, timestamp). Search bar at the top. Clear/Delete options.
    *   **Settings Screen:** Simple list of options (Feedback toggles, Account management).
    *   **Navigation:** Likely bottom tab navigation (`Expo Router` with native tabs) for Scan, History, Settings.
*   **8.2. Key UI Elements:**
    *   Use `NativeWind` for all styling, ensuring consistency.
    *   Clear typography and iconography.
    *   Loading indicators for asynchronous actions (e.g., signing in).
    *   Error messages displayed non-intrusively.
    *   Use `Expo Image` for optimized image loading.
    *   Consider `Zego` for context menus on history items (e.g., Copy, Delete, Share).
*   **8.3. User Flow Diagrams:** (To be provided or developed). Key flows: Scan -> Action, View History -> View Detail, Sign Up/In.
